## AROMA (Analysis of Receptor Organization for Molecular Activity)
AROMA is an application intended to provide guidance for deorphanization experimentation planning, ligand predictions, and rational repellent design. 
AROMA is based on a Semi-supervised label propagation (diffusion) model of currently deorphanized Dipteran Odorant Receptors.

Version 1 still in development, comeback soon!
